# Code of Ethics

## Purpose

Having our company ethics in writing doesn't mean that we don't trust
our employees and contributors. We strive to hire ethical people who
have their own personal standards, so we expect that a written code
won't be necessary most of the time.

But, it can still be helpful. You may find yourself in a situation where
you're not sure how you should act. Life is full of grey areas where
right and wrong aren't so apparent. Some ethics also correspond to laws
that you absolutely must know to do your job properly, so we will
mention them in this Code of Ethics.

Additionally, every company makes bad hires every once in a while.
We also can't predict how people are going to behave. When an employee
behaves, or intents to behave, in a way that's against our professional
ethics, or applicable laws, we will have clear guidelines on what
disciplinary actions we will consider.

For these reasons, we advise you to read this document carefully and
consult with the project maintainers, if you have any doubts or questions.

## The Code of Ethics components

We base our Code of Ethics on common principles of ethics:

- Respect for others. Treat people as you want to be treated.
- Integrity and honesty. Tell the truth and avoid any wrongdoing to the
  best of your ability.
- Justice. Make sure you're objective and fair and don't disadvantage
  others.
- Lawfulness. Know and follow the law – always.
- Competence and accountability. Work hard and be responsible for your
  work.
- Teamwork. Collaborate and ask for help.

## Respect for others

It's mandatory to respect everyone you interact with. Be kind, polite
and understanding. You must respect others' personal space, opinions
and privacy.

Any kind of violence is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate
termination. You're also not allowed to harass or victimize others.
What constitutes harassment or victimization? To answer this, see our
[Harassment Policy](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/legal/Harassment.md)
and our [Sexual Harassment Policy](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/legal/SexualHarassment.md).

As a general rule, try to put yourself in someone else's place.
How would you feel if someone behaved a specific way to you? If the
answer is "I wouldn't like it much" or "I would never let them behave
like that to me", then don't behave like this no matter the person it's
directed against.

If someone, be it user, colleague or stakeholder, is offensive,
demeaning or threatening toward you or someone you know, report them
immediately. You can also report rudeness and dismissiveness if they
become excessive or frequent.

## Integrity and honesty

First, always keep in mind our mission. We all work together to achieve
specific outcomes. Your behavior should contribute to our goals, whether
financial or organizational. Be honest and transparent when you act in
ways that impact other people (e.g. taking strategic decisions or deciding
on layoffs). We don't tolerate malicious, deceitful or petty conduct.
Lies and cheating are huge red flags and, if you're discovered, you may
face progressive discipline or immediate termination depending on the
damage you did.

Stealing from the company or other people is illegal. If you're caught,
you will face repercussions depending on the severity of your actions.
For example, if you steal personal data (e.g. engaging in fraud or
embezzlement), you will get fired and face legal consequences. The decision
is at the project maintainers' discretion on a case-by-case basis.

## Conflict of interest

Conflict of interest may occur whenever your interest in a particular
subject leads you to actions, activities or relationships that undermine
our company. This includes situations like using your position's authority
for your own personal gain or exploiting company resources to support a
personal money-making business.

Even when you seemingly act to the company's advantage, you may actually
disadvantage it. For example, if an employee uses dubious methods to get
competitor intel and raise their sales record, their action will have a
positive impact on the company's revenue, but it will put us at a legal
risk and promote unhealthy business practices.

If it turns out you have created a conflict of interest for yourself,
you will be terminated. If the conflict of interest was involuntary
(e.g. buying stocks from a company without knowing they're a competitor),
we will take actions to rectify the situation. If you repeat the offence,
you may be terminated.

## Justice

Don't act in a way that exploits others, their hard work or their mistakes.
Give everyone equal opportunity and speak up when someone else doesn't.
Be objective when making decisions that can impact other people,
including when you're deciding to hire, promote or fire someone.
Be sure that you can justify any decision with written records or examples.
Seek and use the most objective methods in any case; for example, when
interviewing candidates, ask the same interview questions to all of them
and avoid judging non-job-related criteria, like dress, appearance, etc.

Also, don't discriminate against people with protected characteristics,
as this is forbidden by our [Terms of Use](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/legal/TermsOfUse.md).
If you suspect you may have an unconscious bias that influences your
decisions, ask for help from a project maintainer.

When exercising authority, be fair. Don't show favoritism toward specific
employees and be transparent when you decide to praise or reward an
employee. You're also forbidded from having a reporting relationship
with a relative. If you need to discipline an employee, be sure to have
prepared a case that you can present to a project maintainer. You must
not retaliate against employees or applicants (such as in cases when
they've filed complaints) as this is forbidden by law.

Be just toward customers or vendors, too. If you think our company was
in the wrong in a specific instance, don't try to cover it up or accuse
the other side. Discuss with a project maintainer to find solutions that
can benefit both sides.

## Lawfulness

You are obliged to follow all laws which apply to our organization.
Depending on your role and profession, there might be various laws you
need to observe. For example, accountants and medical professionals have
their own legal restrictions and they must be fully aware of them.
When you're preparing contracts, clauses, disclaimers or online copy
that may be governed by law (such as consent forms), please ask
verification from project maintainers before finalizing anything.

You must not expose, disclose or endanger information of customers,
employees, stakeholders or our business. Always follow our [Cybersecurity Policy](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/legal/Cybersecurity.md),
too. Following laws regarding fraud, bribery, corruption and any kind of
assault is a given. You are also obliged to follow laws on child labor
and avoid doing business with unlawful organizations. If you're not sure
what the law is in a specific instance, don't hesitate to ask a project
maintainer.

## Competence and accountability

We all need to put a healthy amount of effort in our work. Not just
because we're all responsible for Voxelcraft's success, but also because
slacking off affects our colleagues. Incomplete or slow working might
hinder other people's work or cause them to shoulder the burden themselves.
This comes in direct conflict with our respect and integrity principles.

Also, take responsibility for your actions. We all make mistakes or
need to make tough decisions and it's important we own up to them.
Failing to be accountable on a regular basis or in important situations
(e.g. a crucial mistake in our financial records) will result in
termination. If you take responsibility and come up with ways to fix
your mistakes where possible, you will be in a far better position.

## Teamwork

Working well with others is a virtue, rather than an obligation. You will
certainly get to work autonomously and be focused on your own projects
and responsibilities. But, you should also be ready to collaborate with
and help others. Be generous with your expertise and knowledge. Be open
to learning and evolving. If days go by without you consulting or
brainstorming with anyone, you are missing out on opportunities for
excellence. Instead, work with others and don't hesitate to ask for help
when you need it.
